## Quick start

1. Download the project `<%- name %>` from version control system and go to project directory with command `cd <%- name %>`
1. Download dependencies and tools with command `npm install`.
1. Start the microservice server with command `npm start` - server runs on `http://localhost:<%- port %>`.
1. Open UI in browser with URL `http://localhost:<%- port %>`. On top right side of the UI web page is documentation, schema and generated client code for the microservice.
1. UI gives either forms for filling in request parameters, or CURL command to test the action form terminal.

## Notes for Developers

* Installation of tools and runtime dependencies: `npm install`.
* Regular service start: `npm start`.
* Service start for development: `npm run dev` - compiles code and restarts server by each file save.
* End-to-end test execution: `npm test` - the tested server has to be started separately with `npm start` before test is executed.

## Docker

1. Build the microservice image with `docker-compose build` command.
1. Run the container with `docker-compoe up` command.
1. Test the microservice with browser on URL `[docker-machine-url]:<%- port %>`, where the [docker-machine-url] is the IP address of the docker runtime - typically either `localhost` by native docker installation, or `192.168.99.100` if Docker runs in VirtualBox.
1. Run the end-to-end tests with `npm test` to test the microservice running in the Docker container.
